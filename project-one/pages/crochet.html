        <p class="centered-text">My love for crochet came a little out of nowhere and yet not at the same time. I learned when I was 17 but did so out of boredom. Years later, at the age of 27, my best friend phoned me and was talking about how she started crocheting again. I had literally just found some of my old crochet stuff and told her that I would try to get back into it as well. Days later, I had a blanket started and have never looked back! My favorite crochet projects are typically with using thread instead of thicker yarn. I absolutely love making doilies and have also made other kinds of blankets, coasters, dishtowel holders, tablecloths, baskets, and plushies. I am self-taught and in the last few years I have been trying to make things on my own, without patterns and so far, I have learned a lot more and am still working on my craft and skills. In the pictures above, I made a crochet “vase” that holds four coasters with a flower that sits on top. I made these with no patterns. The other picture is a crochet oblong thread doily. The tear-drop shapes are called pineapples, and they can be a pain but come out looking beautiful.</p>
